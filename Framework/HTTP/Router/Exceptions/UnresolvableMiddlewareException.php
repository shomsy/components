 * Typical use case:
 * - This exception may be thrown during runtime when middleware identified
 *   by name, configuration, or parameters cannot be instantiated or located.
 *
 * Design Considerations:
 * - This is part of the overall exception hierarchy, promoting better error
 *   differentiation and allowing targeted exception handling.
