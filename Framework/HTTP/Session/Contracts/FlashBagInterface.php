/**
 * Interface FlashBagInterface
 *
 * This interface defines the contract for managing a flash-based temporary session store.
 * Flash bags are designed to hold transient data, meant to persist only across a single request-response cycle.
 * It extends the SessionBagInterface for consistent session operations, adding functionality specific to flash data.
 *
 * Example Use Cases:
 * - Storing success messages after form submissions.
 * - Passing transient errors or warnings between requests.
 * - Temporary state management that requires automatic expiration.
 *

     * Flash data is commonly designed to be cleared after the next access.
     * The `keep` method ensures that a particular key's value is retained for subsequent processing.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```php
     * $flashBag->keep('successMessage');
     * ```
     * Retention can be useful for cases where data should be available for longer interactions.
