Alright, let’s tear into this. What you've got here is a solid start—modular, interface-driven, and respects several clean architecture principles. But you didn’t come here for a gold star, you came for critique. So here’s the breakdown, piece by piece:

---

### 🔹 **ConnectionPool (a.k.a. “The Muscle”)**

#### ✅ **What’s great:**
- **SRP? Nailed.** It only manages DB connections. No SQL running, no biz logic creeping in.
- **DIP Compliant:** Injects config and logger—no tight coupling. Bravo.
- **Max Connections:** Soft cap to avoid overloading the DB—good operational awareness.
- **Health Checks:** `SELECT 1` to test connection liveliness. It’s basic, but it works.
- **Logging:** Everything worth logging is logged, both on success and failure.

#### ⚠️ **Nitpicks and Room for Growth:**
1. **Hardcoded `config()` call:**
   Inside `getConnection`, you fall back on `config('database.default')`. But the rest of your class is fully DI-driven. Why the sudden global config call? Either pass it via the constructor or don't mix styles.

2. **Connection Pool? More like “Singleton Manager”:**
   You allow *one* connection per named DB. That’s not *really* a pool—it’s a registry of singleton connections. True pooling would juggle multiple per name.

3. **Releasing connections does… nothing.**
   It logs, then bounces. You’re not really managing a pool with free/used slots. There’s no eviction, reuse queue, or max idle policy.

4. **Thread Safety?**
   Not PHP’s biggest problem normally, but worth noting: this “pool” isn’t concurrent-safe. Under a worker model (Swoole, RoadRunner), this will bite you.

### 🔹 **ConnectionPoolInterface**

#### ✅ **Spotless.**
- Very clean, clear abstraction. Just the essentials.
- No bloat, no unnecessary complexity.

#### ⚠️ **Maybe an enhancement:**
- Could optionally have a `hasConnection(string): bool` or `closeConnection(string): void` if you ever want more control.
- Add PHPDoc return types for IDE friendliness.

### 🔹 **DatabaseConnection (a.k.a. “The Gateway Drug”)**

#### ✅ **Awesome Stuff:**
- **`readonly class`** usage: Lovely for immutability.
- **Security awareness:** Emulated prepares disabled *again* at the consumer level. Paranoid? Yes. Wrong? Never.
- **Logging, fail-fast, and testability:** You clearly know what you’re doing.

#### ⚠️ **Critique Time:**
1. **Redundant `setAttribute` on `PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES`:**
   It’s already set in `ConnectionPool::initializeConnection`. Doing it again is harmless, but noisy. Unless you're paranoid someone could change it post-hoc (but you control the codebase, right?).

2. **Why call `releaseConnection()` on a `readonly` object?**
   Feels a bit off. “Releasing” implies some internal state change, but your object can’t mutate. Maybe that's just aesthetic, but worth questioning.

3. **You throw a generic `RuntimeException` on failure to connect.**
   You could subclass this (e.g., `DatabaseConnectionException`) to differentiate failures.

### 🧼 Clean Architecture Vibe Check

- **SRP:** All components have focused responsibilities.
- **DIP:** Interfaces all the way down. Solid.
- **ISP & LSP:** Not immediately relevant here, but no violations.
- **Loose Coupling:** You’re passing in contracts, not concrete implementations. Gold star.
- **Testability:** DI + interfaces = very testable. Just mock the pool and logger.

### 💡 Suggestions

1. **Rename `ConnectionPool` to something more honest**, like `ConnectionRegistry`—unless you plan to actually implement pooling.
2. **Add real pooling behavior.** Queue of available PDOs per connection name, round-robin or LRU eviction, max idle time, etc.
3. **Add metrics support.** Emit events or integrate a counter system (e.g., Prometheus) to monitor pool usage.
4. **Consider thread safety** if you're ever going multi-thread or persistent process model.

### Final Verdict

You're walking the clean architecture walk, no doubt. This is *very* solid, especially for a microframework. You've got structure, boundaries, and intentions all in place. It just needs a few refinements to be truly “production-hardcore.”
