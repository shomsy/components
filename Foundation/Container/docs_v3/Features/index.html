            <h2>Quick Summary</h2>
            <p>The Features folder contains specialized modules that extend the container's basic functionality with advanced capabilities. It implements complex dependency injection patterns, lifecycle management, and integration features that go beyond simple service resolution.</p>
            <p>This folder exists because real-world applications need more than basic dependency injection— they require sophisticated features like method injection, scope management, caching, and integration with external systems.</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This is where the container gets superpowers. The core handles the basics, but this folder adds the advanced features that make the container useful for complex, real-world applications. It's like the difference between a basic toolbox and a professional workshop.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="terminology" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Actions:</strong> Executable operations that the container can perform on services</li>
                <li><strong>Define:</strong> Service definition and binding mechanisms</li>
                <li><strong>Operate:</strong> Runtime operations and lifecycle management</li>
                <li><strong>Think:</strong> Analysis and optimization components</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Features:</strong> Sophisticated capabilities beyond basic resolution</li>
                <li><strong>Integration Points:</strong> Connection mechanisms with external systems</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>Actions are things the container can do. Define is about setting up services. Operate handles running and managing them. Think is about analyzing and improving performance. These are the specialized tools that make the container powerful.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="think-of-it" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Think Of It</h2>
            <p>Imagine the Features folder as a professional workshop extension to a basic garage. The core container is your reliable car that gets you from A to B, but the features are the turbocharger, GPS navigation, entertainment system, and advanced safety features.</p>

            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>The Features folder transforms your container from a simple service locator into a sophisticated dependency injection framework. It's what turns basic functionality into enterprise-grade capabilities.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="story-example" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Story Example</h2>
            <p>You're building a large e-commerce platform with complex requirements: automatic dependency injection, request-scoped services, method injection for legacy code, performance monitoring, and integration with multiple external services.</p>
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Basic dependency injection works for simple cases, but complex applications need advanced features like scoped lifecycles, injection into existing objects, and performance optimization.</p>
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>The Features folder provides all these advanced capabilities as modular components that extend the core container without complicating the basic functionality.</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This folder solves the problem of "how do I handle complex dependency injection scenarios?" It provides the advanced tools and patterns that professional applications need, while keeping the core simple and reliable.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="for-dummies" class="section content-card">
            <h2>For Dummies</h2>
            <p>The Features folder is like the premium add-ons for your container. The basic container works fine, but these features make it much more powerful and useful for serious applications.</p>
            <h3>Why Do You Need These?</h3>
            <p>Simple applications might get by with basic dependency injection, but real-world apps need features like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Injecting dependencies into existing objects</li>
                <li>Managing different scopes (request, session, etc.)</li>
                <li>Caching and performance optimization</li>
                <li>Integration with external systems</li>
                <li>Advanced binding and configuration options</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This is where the container grows up. The core is the foundation, but the features are what make it ready for professional use. They're optional but essential for complex applications.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="how-it-works" class="section content-card">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>The features operate as layered extensions to the core:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Core Integration:</strong> Features build upon the kernel's foundation</li>
                <li><strong>Modular Design:</strong> Each feature is self-contained but interoperable</li>
                <li><strong>Configuration-Driven:</strong> Features are enabled and configured through settings</li>
                <li><strong>Runtime Activation:</strong> Features activate based on context and requirements</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Features include caching and optimization mechanisms</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>Features plug into the core like modules in a modular system. They're designed to work together seamlessly, but you can use only what you need. They're smart about when to activate and how to optimize performance.</p>

        <section id="risks-trade-offs" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Risks, Trade-offs & Recommended Practices</h2>
            <h3>Complexity Overhead</h3>
            <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Advanced features introduce complexity that may not be needed for simple applications.</p>
            <p><strong>Design Stance:</strong> Features are optional and modular.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommended Practice:</strong> Use only the features you actually need.</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>Don't load up on features just because they're available. Each feature adds some complexity, so choose wisely based on your actual needs.</p>
            <h3>Performance Impact</h3>
            <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Advanced features can impact performance if not used carefully.</p>
            <p><strong>Design Stance:</strong> Features include optimization and caching mechanisms.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommended Practice:</strong> Profile and optimize feature usage in production.</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>Features are powerful but not free. They can slow things down if misused, so monitor performance and optimize as needed.</p>
