            <h2>Quick Summary</h2>
            <p>The Actions folder contains the concrete implementations of executable operations that the container can perform on services. It provides the mechanisms for dependency injection, service instantiation, method invocation, and advanced resolution strategies.</p>
            <p>This folder exists because containers don't just store services—they need to actively manipulate and prepare them. Actions are the verbs that make the container do things, not just hold things.</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This is where the container becomes active rather than passive. Instead of just being a storage system, it can actually do work: inject dependencies, create objects, call methods, and resolve complex scenarios. It's the container's toolkit for getting things done.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="terminology" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inject:</strong> The process of providing dependencies to objects</li>
                <li><strong>Instantiate:</strong> Creating new object instances</li>
                <li><strong>Invoke:</strong> Calling methods or functions with dependency injection</li>
                <li><strong>Resolve:</strong> Finding and preparing services for use</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> Sophisticated action implementations for complex scenarios</li>
                <li><strong>Action Pipeline:</strong> Sequence of operations performed during service preparation</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>Inject puts things into objects. Instantiate makes new objects. Invoke calls methods. Resolve finds and prepares services. Advanced handles tricky cases. The pipeline is the step-by-step process that turns raw services into usable components.</p>

            <h2>Think Of It</h2>
            <p>Imagine the Actions folder as a skilled craftsman workshop. The core container provides the raw materials and basic tools, but the Actions are the specialized artisans who know how to assemble, finish, and prepare each piece.</p>
            <div class="table-wrapper">
                <table>
                    <thead>

            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>The Actions folder transforms passive service definitions into active, working components. It's not enough to know what a service is—you need to know how to properly prepare and use it. This folder contains the expertise for doing that correctly.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="story-example" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Story Example</h2>
            <p>You're building a content management system where articles need to be created with their dependencies (database, cache, logger), rendered with proper formatting, and saved with metadata tracking.</p>
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Manual object creation and dependency management leads to scattered code and inconsistent initialization patterns.</p>
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>The Actions folder provides standardized mechanisms for instantiation, injection, and invocation that ensure consistent service preparation across the application.</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This solves the problem of "how do I consistently create and prepare complex objects?" Instead of writing custom initialization code everywhere, you get standardized actions that handle the common patterns automatically.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="for-dummies" class="section content-card">
            <h2>For Dummies</h2>
            <p>The Actions folder is like the container's action verbs. It contains the code that actually does things with services, rather than just storing them.</p>
            <h3>What Actions Can Do</h3>
            <p>The container can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inject:</strong> Put dependencies into objects</li>
                <li><strong>Instantiate:</strong> Create new objects from classes</li>
                <li><strong>Invoke:</strong> Call methods with automatic dependency injection</li>
                <li><strong>Resolve:</strong> Figure out how to provide requested services</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> Handle complex scenarios and edge cases</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This is what makes dependency injection useful. It's not just about storing objects—it's about actively managing how they're created, connected, and used. Without actions, the container would be like a warehouse with no forklifts.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="how-it-works" class="section content-card">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Actions operate through coordinated pipelines:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Action requested by kernel or application code</li>
                <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Determine what needs to be done based on context</li>
                <li><strong>Execution:</strong> Perform the specific action (inject, instantiate, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Coordinate with other actions in the pipeline</li>
                <li><strong>Completion:</strong> Return prepared service or confirmation</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>Actions work like a well-choreographed dance. Each action knows its role and timing, and they coordinate to produce the final result. The container orchestrates this automatically based on what you ask for.</p>

            <h2>Architecture Role</h2>
            <p>This folder implements the active service manipulation layer of the dependency injection system. It provides the executable capabilities that transform passive service definitions into functional application components.</p>
            <h3>What Depends on This</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Container kernel for service preparation</li>
                <li>Application code requiring dependency injection</li>
                <li>Framework integrations needing service manipulation</li>
                <li>Advanced features requiring action coordination</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What This Depends On</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Core kernel infrastructure</li>
                <li>Service definitions and bindings</li>
                <li>PHP reflection capabilities</li>
                <li>Configuration settings</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This folder is the heart of the container's active capabilities. Everything that actually uses the container—creating objects, injecting dependencies, calling methods—flows through these actions. It's where the rubber meets the road.</p>

            <h2>Risks, Trade-offs & Recommended Practices</h2>
            <h3>Performance Overhead</h3>
            <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Complex actions can slow down service resolution.</p>
            <p><strong>Design Stance:</strong> Actions are optimized and cached where possible.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommended Practice:</strong> Use simple actions for performance-critical paths.</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>Actions are powerful but not free. For high-performance scenarios, you might want to use simpler approaches. The trade-off is between convenience and speed.</p>
            <h3>Complexity Management</h3>
            <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Advanced actions can be difficult to understand and debug.</p>
            <p><strong>Design Stance:</strong> Actions are modular and well-documented.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommended Practice:</strong> Start with simple actions, add complexity as needed.</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>Don't use advanced actions just because they're cool. Keep it simple unless you actually need the complexity. Simple actions are easier to debug and maintain.</p>
