            <h2>Quick Summary</h2>
            <p>The Core folder contains the essential runtime components that orchestrate all container operations. It implements the kernel pattern where ContainerKernel acts as the central coordinator, managing resolution pipelines, scoping, and injection through specialized subsystems.</p>
            <p>This folder exists because dependency injection requires sophisticated coordination between multiple concerns—binding resolution, lifecycle management, and injection—all of which must work together seamlessly.</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This is the container's brain and nervous system. While other parts handle specific jobs like configuration or security, this folder makes sure everything works together smoothly, like a conductor leading an orchestra where each musician plays their part perfectly.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="terminology" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kernel:</strong> The central orchestrator that coordinates all container operations</li>
                <li><strong>Resolution Pipeline:</strong> A sequence of processing steps that transform service requests into instances</li>
                <li><strong>Runtime:</strong> The execution environment where services are instantiated and managed</li>
                <li><strong>Facade:</strong> A unified interface that simplifies access to complex subsystems</li>
                <li><strong>Context:</strong> Metadata that accompanies resolution requests to guide the process</li>
                <li><strong>Orchestration:</strong> The coordination of multiple components to achieve a unified goal</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>These terms describe how the core acts as a smart manager. The kernel is the boss who delegates work, pipelines are the assembly lines, runtime is the workshop, and facades are the front desks that make complex systems easy to use.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="think-of-it" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Think Of It</h2>
            <p>Imagine a high-tech factory control room where multiple automated systems work together to manufacture products on demand. The Core folder is this control room:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ContainerKernel is the master control system monitoring all operations</li>
                <li>Resolution pipelines are the automated assembly lines</li>
                <li>Runtime components are the robotic arms and conveyor belts</li>
                <li>Configuration management is the programmable logic controllers</li>
                <li>Scope management is the inventory tracking system</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>The Core folder turns the container from a simple toolbox into an intelligent manufacturing system. Instead of manually assembling each part, you have a factory that knows how to build anything you need, exactly when you need it, with perfect quality control.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="story-example" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Story Example</h2>
            <p>You're building a complex web application where user requests trigger a cascade of operations: authentication, database queries, business logic, caching, and response formatting. Each operation depends on multiple services with different lifecycles.</p>
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Without centralized orchestration, each component would need to know how to create and manage all its dependencies, leading to scattered, hard-to-maintain code.</p>
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>The Core folder provides the orchestration layer where ContainerKernel manages the entire resolution process, ensuring each service gets its dependencies at the right time with proper lifecycle management.</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This solves the problem of "how do I make a complex system where everything works together without everything knowing about everything else?" The core acts as the traffic controller that ensures each car (service) gets to its destination without collisions.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="for-dummies" class="section content-card">
            <h2>For Dummies</h2>
            <p>The Core folder is like the engine room of a ship. While the passengers enjoy the cruise and the crew handles specific tasks, the engine room makes sure everything runs smoothly.</p>
            <h3>Why Is This Important?</h3>
            <p>Dependency injection is complex because objects need other objects to work. This folder handles all the complexity of figuring out what needs what and when, so you don't have to.</p>
            <h3>Simple Mental Model</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>You ask for a service</li>
                <li>The kernel checks if it exists or can be made</li>
                <li>The pipeline figures out what dependencies are needed</li>
                <li>Everything gets built in the right order</li>
                <li>You get a fully working service</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This is the magic that makes dependency injection work. Instead of you worrying about the thousands of connections between objects, the core handles it all automatically, like a smart assistant who anticipates what you need before you ask.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="how-it-works" class="section content-card">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>The core operates through a layered architecture:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Entry Point:</strong> ContainerKernel receives service requests</li>
                <li><strong>Fast Path:</strong> Check scopes for existing instances</li>
                <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Delegate to runtime through pipeline</li>
                <li><strong>Instantiation:</strong> Build dependencies recursively</li>
                <li><strong>Lifecycle:</strong> Apply scope rules and post-processing</li>
                <li><strong>Return:</strong> Provide fully configured service instance</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>The core is like a professional kitchen brigade. When you order a dish, the chef (kernel) coordinates with the saucier (runtime), garde manger (scopes), and others to prepare each component perfectly, then presents you with a complete meal.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="architecture-role" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Architecture Role</h2>
            <p>This folder establishes the architectural core of the entire dependency injection system. It implements the composition root pattern and provides the stable runtime foundation that all other features build upon.</p>
            <h3>What Depends on This</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All service resolution and instantiation</li>
                <li>Scope and lifecycle management</li>
                <li>Advanced features like injection and invocation</li>
                <li>Monitoring and diagnostics systems</li>
                <li>Security and policy enforcement</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What This Depends On</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>PHP reflection system</li>
                <li>Definition storage (bindings)</li>
                <li>Configuration management</li>
                <li>Basic language constructs</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This is the foundation that everything else rests on. Like the engine in a car, it's not flashy, but without it, nothing moves. Every feature you use ultimately goes through this core system.</p>

        <section id="risks-trade-offs" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Risks, Trade-offs & Recommended Practices</h2>
            <h3>Complexity Management</h3>
            <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Core orchestration logic becomes difficult to maintain as features grow.</p>
            <p><strong>Design Stance:</strong> Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommended Practice:</strong> Keep core logic focused, delegate specialized work to feature modules.</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>The core could become a tangled mess if everything is crammed here. Instead, it's designed like a well-organized control center where each button controls one specific system.</p>
            <h3>Performance Overhead</h3>
            <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Multiple layers of indirection slow down service resolution.</p>
            <p><strong>Design Stance:</strong> Optimized fast paths and caching to minimize overhead.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommended Practice:</strong> Use singleton scopes for expensive services, enable compilation for production.</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>While the core does more work than direct instantiation, the performance cost is usually negligible compared to the benefits of maintainable, testable code.</p>
