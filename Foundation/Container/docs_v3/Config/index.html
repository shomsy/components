            <h2>Quick Summary</h2>
            <p>The Config folder provides lightweight configuration management for container-scoped settings. It stores configuration arrays with dot-notated key access, enabling flexible configuration storage and retrieval without external dependencies.</p>
            <p>This folder exists because containers need configurable behavior, and this provides a simple, self-contained way to manage settings that affect container operation.</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This is like having a settings panel for your container. Instead of hardcoding values everywhere, you can store configuration in one place and access it easily with simple keys. It's the container's way of remembering your preferences and behaving differently based on those settings.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="terminology" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Configuration:</strong> Application settings that control behavior without changing code</li>
                <li><strong>Dot Notation:</strong> Using dots in keys like "database.host" to create hierarchical settings</li>
                <li><strong>Container Scope:</strong> Settings that apply to the container's operation rather than application business logic</li>
                <li><strong>Settings Store:</strong> In-memory storage for configuration values with get/set/has operations</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>Configuration is just adjustable knobs on your container. Dot notation lets you organize settings in a tree structure, and container scope means these settings affect how the container works internally, not what your app does for users.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="think-of-it" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Think Of It</h2>
            <p>Imagine your container as a highly customizable kitchen appliance. The Config folder is the control panel where you set preferences like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Temperature settings (performance tuning)</li>
                <li>Recipe preferences (autowiring behavior)</li>
                <li>Safety features (guard policies)</li>
                <li>Maintenance schedules (caching policies)</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="table-wrapper">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Kitchen Appliance</th>
                            <th>Config Folder</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Control panel with dials and switches</td>
                            <td>Settings class with get/set methods</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Recipe book with adjustable parameters</td>
                            <td>Configuration arrays with dot notation</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Factory presets vs custom settings</td>
                            <td>Default values vs explicit configuration</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>The Config folder gives your container personality. Without it, the container would work in one rigid way. With it, you can tweak how it behaves to match your application's needs, just like adjusting an appliance's settings for different cooking styles.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="story-example" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Story Example</h2>
            <p>You're deploying the container in different environments—development, staging, and production. Each environment needs different settings for caching, logging levels, and security policies.</p>
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Hardcoded settings in the container code make it impossible to change behavior without modifying source code.</p>
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>The Config folder provides a clean API for environment-specific configuration that can be loaded from external files or set programmatically.</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This folder solves the problem of "how do I make my container behave differently in different places?" It gives you a standard way to feed settings into the container so it can adapt to development, testing, or production environments without changing the core code.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="for-dummies" class="section content-card">
            <h2>For Dummies</h2>
            <p>Configuration is just a fancy word for settings. This folder helps the container remember your preferences.</p>
            <h3>Why Do We Need This?</h3>
            <p>Containers need to be flexible. Sometimes you want detailed logging in development but minimal logging in production. This folder lets you control that without rewriting code.</p>
            <h3>How It Works Simply</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a Settings object</li>
                <li>Put your configuration in it like $settings->set('debug', true)</li>
                <li>Later ask for it with $settings->get('debug')</li>
                <li>The container uses these settings to change its behavior</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This is the container's memory. It lets you tell the container "remember this setting" and then the container can act on it later. It's like teaching a smart assistant your preferences so it can help you better.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="how-it-works" class="section content-card">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>The configuration system uses a simple key-value store with dot notation parsing:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Configuration arrays stored in memory</li>
                <li><strong>Access:</strong> Keys split on dots to navigate nested arrays</li>
                <li><strong>Mutation:</strong> Set operations create nested structure automatically</li>
                <li><strong>Defaults:</strong> Get operations return default values for missing keys</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>It's like a file system for settings. You can store things in folders (using dots) and retrieve them easily. If something's missing, you get a sensible default instead of an error.</p>

        <section id="architecture-role" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Architecture Role</h2>
            <p>This folder provides the configuration backbone for the container's operational settings. It enables runtime behavior modification without code changes, supporting different deployment scenarios.</p>
            <h3>What Depends on This</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Container kernel for operational parameters</li>
                <li>Guard components for policy configuration</li>
                <li>Observe components for monitoring settings</li>
                <li>Performance tuning and optimization features</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What This Depends On</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>PHP arrays for storage</li>
                <li>String manipulation for dot notation</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This is the control center. Other parts of the container look here for guidance on how to behave. It's the central nervous system that tells all the other components what mode they're in and how they should operate.</p>

        <section id="risks-trade-offs" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Risks, Trade-offs & Recommended Practices</h2>
            <h3>Memory Usage</h3>
            <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Large configuration arrays consume memory.</p>
            <p><strong>Design Stance:</strong> Keeps configuration lightweight and focused on container concerns.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommended Practice:</strong> Use for container settings only, not application data.</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>Don't store your entire application's configuration here—it's meant for container-specific settings. Think of it as the container's personal notepad, not a full filing cabinet.</p>
