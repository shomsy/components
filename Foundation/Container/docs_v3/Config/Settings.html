            <h2>Quick Summary</h2>
            <p>Settings.php implements a simple key-value configuration store with dot notation support. It allows storing and retrieving configuration values using hierarchical keys like "database.host", making it easy to organize settings without complex structures.</p>
            <p>This file exists to provide a self-contained configuration storage mechanism that doesn't require external dependencies, focusing specifically on container operational settings rather than application business data.</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This is like a smart notebook for the container's settings. You can write down preferences using simple dotted paths, and later ask for them back. It keeps things organized without needing a full database or complex setup.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="terminology" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dot Notation:</strong> Using periods in keys (e.g., "app.cache.enabled") to create nested configuration hierarchies</li>
                <li><strong>Configuration Store:</strong> In-memory storage for settings that can be accessed by key</li>
                <li><strong>Default Values:</strong> Fallback values returned when a requested key doesn't exist</li>
                <li><strong>Hierarchical Keys:</strong> Keys that represent nested structure through dot separation</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>Dot notation is like using folders in a file system—dots create "subfolders" for your settings. The store is just a memory-based notepad, and defaults prevent errors when you ask for something that isn't there.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="think-of-it" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Think Of It</h2>
            <p>Imagine a well-organized filing cabinet for your container's preferences. Each drawer represents a category, folders within drawers represent subcategories, and documents contain the actual settings.</p>
            <div class="table-wrapper">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Filing Cabinet</th>
                            <th>Settings.php</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Labeled drawers and folders</td>
                            <td>Dot-notated keys like "database.host"</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Pulling out a specific document</td>
                            <td>Calling get("database.host")</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Filing a new document</td>
                            <td>Calling set("database.host", "localhost")</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Checking if a document exists</td>
                            <td>Calling has("database.host")</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This class turns configuration into an organized storage system. Instead of scattered variables everywhere, you have one place to store and retrieve settings in a structured way, just like a well-maintained filing system.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="story-example" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Story Example</h2>
            <p>You're configuring the container for different environments. In development, you want debug logging and fast but unsafe caching. In production, you want minimal logging and slow but reliable caching.</p>
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Without a configuration system, you'd have conditional logic scattered throughout the codebase checking environment variables directly.</p>
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>Settings.php provides a clean abstraction where you can load environment-specific configurations once, then access them consistently throughout the container.</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This solves the problem of "how do I make my container adapt to different environments without changing code?" You load the right settings at startup, and the container behaves appropriately without knowing which environment it's in.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="for-dummies" class="section content-card">
            <h2>For Dummies</h2>
            <p>Settings.php is like a key-value store where keys can have dots to make them organized.</p>
            <h3>Simple Example</h3>
            <pre><code class="language-php">$settings = new Settings();

// Store some values
$settings->set('database.host', 'localhost');
$settings->set('database.port', 3306);
$settings->set('debug', true);

// Get them back
$host = $settings->get('database.host'); // 'localhost'
$port = $settings->get('database.port'); // 3306
$debug = $settings->get('missing', false); // false (default)
</code></pre>
            <h3>Why Dots?</h3>
            <p>Dots let you group related settings: all database stuff under "database.*", all cache stuff under "cache.*".</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This is the container's way of remembering things. You tell it to remember "database.host" is "localhost", and later you can ask "what's the database host?" and it tells you. It's simple but powerful for keeping configuration organized.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="how-it-works" class="section content-card">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>The class uses PHP arrays internally with string manipulation for dot notation:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Single array holds all configuration data</li>
                <li><strong>Get Operation:</strong> Splits key on dots, navigates array structure</li>
                <li><strong>Set Operation:</strong> Creates nested arrays as needed, assigns final value</li>
                <li><strong>Has Operation:</strong> Traverses structure to check existence</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>Under the hood, it's just PHP arrays with some smart string splitting. When you say "database.host", it splits on the dot and looks in $array['database']['host']. Setting creates the nested structure automatically.</p>

        <section id="architecture-role" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Architecture Role</h2>
            <p>This class serves as the foundational configuration storage layer in the container's architecture. It provides the basic CRUD operations for settings that higher-level components build upon.</p>
            <h3>What Depends on This</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Container kernel for operational parameters</li>
                <li>Configuration loaders and parsers</li>
                <li>Environment-specific bootstrap logic</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What This Depends On</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>PHP array functions</li>
                <li>String explode/implode operations</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This is the bottom layer of the configuration pyramid. Everything else that needs settings eventually calls down to this class. It's deliberately simple so that complex configuration logic can be built on top.</p>

        <section id="risks-trade-offs" class="section content-card">
            <h2>Risks, Trade-offs & Recommended Practices</h2>
            <h3>Memory Usage</h3>
            <p><strong>Risk:</strong> All configuration kept in memory simultaneously.</p>
            <p><strong>Design Stance:</strong> Optimized for container startup performance over memory efficiency.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommended Practice:</strong> Keep configurations reasonably sized for container operational settings.</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>Everything stays in memory, so don't load your entire application's configuration here. It's meant for the container's settings, not user data or massive datasets.</p>
            <h3>Type Safety</h3>
            <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Mixed types in configuration without validation.</p>
            <p><strong>Design Stance:</strong> Flexibility prioritized over strict typing for configuration scenarios.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommended Practice:</strong> Validate configuration at application boundaries.</p>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>You can store any type of value (strings, numbers, arrays), which is convenient but means you need to be careful about what you put in and how you use it later.</p>

            <h2>Related Files & Folders</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Config/index.html:</strong> Overview of the configuration folder</li>
                <li><strong>Core/ContainerConfig.php:</strong> Higher-level configuration management</li>
                <li><strong>Operate/Config/:</strong> Bootstrap configuration handling</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>For Humans: What This Means</h3>
            <p>This class is the basic building block. Other files in the config system use it or build more complex features on top of it, like loading from files or managing different environments.</p>
