# 🩺 Troubleshooting Matrix

> **"Everything that can go wrong, will—here's how to fix it."**

When the Container fails, it usually happens at a specific "Station" in
the [Resolution Flow](./concepts/resolution-flow.md). Use this matrix to map your error to a solution.

## 🗺️ The Error Map

| Exception                  | Stage             | Most Likely Cause                                                                          | ✅ How to Fix                                                                            |
|:---------------------------|:------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ServiceNotFoundException` | **Gatekeeper**    | You asked for a class that doesn't exist or isn't autowirable.                             | Check the class name or [register it manually](./index.md).                             |
| `RecursionException`       | **Loop Detector** | Class A needs B, and B needs A.                                                            | Use **Lazy Loading** or reconsider your architecture.                                   |
| `ResolutionException`      | **The Birth**     | The constructor has a parameter that can't be resolved (e.g., an `int` without a default). | Add a default value or provide the parameter via [manual binding](./Container.md#make). |
| `ResolutionException`      | **The Wiring**    | A property marked with `#[Inject]` has a type that doesn't exist.                          | Ensure the injected class is registered and autowired.                                  |
| `SecurityException`        | **Gatekeeper**    | A [Guard](./Guard/index.md) prevented access to this service.                              | Check your environment permissions or firewall rules.                                   |

## 🛠️ The "Black Box" Strategy

If the error isn't clear, use the **Black Box approach**:

1. **Check Telemetry**: Look at the output of `exportMetrics()`. It shows the resolution depth.
2. **Inspect Injection**: Use `$container->inspectInjection($obj)` to see what the container thinks it should be doing.
3. **Verify Context**: If using complex resolution, check the `KernelContext` state.

## 🧪 PHPUnit Coverage Driver Warning

Technical: PHPUnit will emit `No code coverage driver is available` when Xdebug/PCOV isn’t installed in the PHP
runtime (Herd ships without one by default). Coverage reports will be empty until a driver is present.

### For Humans: What This Means

If you want coverage numbers, install Xdebug or PCOV in your PHP environment (e.g., enable Xdebug in Herd or add PCOV
via PECL). If you don’t need coverage locally, ignore the warning or disable coverage collection in your phpunit
command.
