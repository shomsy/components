# 🏗️ Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

> **"Architecture is the decisions that you wish you could get right early in a project."** — Ralph Johnson

This folder contains a collection of records for the significant architectural decisions made during the development of the Avax Container. Each record describes the context, the decision itself, and the consequences (both good and bad).

> **Why ADRs?** Code tells you *how*, but ADRs tell you *why*. They prevent "Chesterton's Fence" moments where future developers (including you) might remove something important because they don't understand its original purpose.
